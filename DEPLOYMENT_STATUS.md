# ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Status - RESOLVED

## Issue Resolution Summary

The deployment routing issue has been **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**! 

### What was the problem?
The GitHub Pages deployment was showing the README file instead of the actual React application. This was happening because:
1. **Build failures**: The project had lint errors preventing successful builds
2. **Deployment artifacts**: GitHub Actions was failing to create deployments due to build failures

### What was fixed?
âœ… **Fixed all lint errors:**
- Removed unused imports and variables from React components
- Fixed accessibility issues with anchor tags (replaced with buttons where appropriate)
- Cleaned up unused context imports

âœ… **Successful GitHub Actions deployment:**
- Build now completes successfully without errors
- GitHub Actions workflow deploys built React app to GitHub Pages
- The `build` directory is correctly uploaded as deployment artifact

### Current Status
ðŸš€ **The React application is now successfully deployed at:**
[https://abhijit1018.github.io/Company-portfolio/](https://abhijit1018.github.io/Company-portfolio/)

### Technical Details
- **Homepage URL**: Correctly configured in `package.json`
- **Build Process**: React app builds to `/build` directory 
- **Deployment**: GitHub Actions workflow deploys using official `actions/deploy-pages`
- **Workflow Status**: âœ… Latest deployment (run #20) completed successfully

The site now serves the actual React portfolio application instead of the README file.
